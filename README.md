# Instaructor
Master-Slave Application for Instructors or Lab Administrators to manage and control Lab Computers using tcp sockets
<hr>
<h3>These are two javafx projects Client and Server (Prototype)</h3>
<p>It targets collage or school computer labs to increase instructor's time to teach the students the course's contents</p>
<p>not to waste their time installing softwares passing some soft copies over usb flash and so by allowing the instructor to</p>
<p>send files in parallel to multiple computers.</p>
<p>Also giving the student the ability to request for help, notify the instructor that a task is finished, chat with the instructor</p>
<p>Also giving the ability to the instructor to chat, notify students</p>
<p>Also providing the instructor with commands area thats supports saving CMD or bash or shell commands at a list that he can select</p>
<p>to be executed over the selected computers that he/she wants to execute at or simply execute a command he/she can type</p>
<p>Also the ability to view student's screen and control it with Mouse and Keyboard.</p>
<p>For the screen mirroring I used an existing application for screen sharing and keybord and mouse control you can find it
<a href="https://github.com/rajpushkar/Remote-Desktop-Control">here</a> I modified it to be part of my application</p>
<p>I am also using a cool library for Notifications <a href='https://github.com/PlusHaze/TrayNotification'>Tray Notification</a></p>
<p>the jar file must be imported at the two projects (Client/Server) and also you can customize it as you wish</p>

<h3>Note:</h3>
<p>The GUI isn't good it was just for testing and the two projects are prototypes</p>
